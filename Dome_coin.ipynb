        "A `virtual environment` allows you to create an isolated space where your project (or a group of projects) can install its external packages. This is especially helpful when you're managing multiple projects on your machine. Often, external packages update their classes and methods when new versions are released. However, separate virtual environments can have different versions of the same package installed - that way, each project can rely on the versions of their dependencies to stay consistent.\n",

        "A package in python allows you to group together related modules. To create a package, create a directory with an `__init__`.py file. Python will then recognize the directory as a package, allowing you to import modules contained in that package with a dot syntax. For example, the blockchain/ directory contains both __init__.py and block.py. This allows other files to import the block module with blockchain.block.\n",

So let's focus on functionality like the validation and replacement of chains in the next section, as we prepare the blockchain for collaboration!"
