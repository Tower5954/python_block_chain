        "* The `blockchain` is list of `blocks` where each block represents a unit of storage for data. The list is called a chain because each block references the block before it, creating (chain) links between between blocks. In a blockchain that supports a cryptocurrency, blocks store transactions.\n",

The `__name__` value in Python reflects the name of the module it's used within, except when the file is directly executed. When a file is directly executed the __name__ value becomes `__main__`.\n",

        "* A `lambda` in python is a function that can be declared inline. In the project so far, we've used it for the `map()` method which can transform a list into a new list. The map function's first parameter is a lambda, which defines how to transform each item in the original list to produce the new list."
